# Game Description
'Forest Frenzy' is a 2D top down game made in the Unity Game Engine. In this action-packed game, players navigate through a thick jungle filled with vast vegetation. They are also faced with different variants
of enemies such as Bolt, Coconut and The Driller. 

# Game Mechanics
**1. QTE Bar Combat System**: Players are greeted with a QTE Bar on their screen which is their attack system. Players have to successfully hit the red line at the correct timing when the white line aligns with the 
                              red line. Upon a successful hit, the character, which his name is 'Biggie' will emit a ranged coin explosion, which deals damage to nearby enemies and instantly kills them.

**2. Missed hit on the QTE Bar**: If the player accidentally misses the red line, nothing happens and the explosion is not emitted. However, if they spam the button and constantly miss the line, their combo 
                                  multiplier, which is earned by eliminating enemies, will gradually decrease. So, if players want to keep their combo multiplier, they have to always time their hit correctly.

**3. Explosion Barrels**: Explosive barrels will be scattered around the jungle and players can use these barrels to their advantage. If they are near a barrel and they time their QTE correctly, they can also 
                          explode the barrel with their attack, which can instantly wipe out any nearby enemies. However, players have to be careful as the barrels can also damage the player.

**4. Coins**: Coins are one of the currency in the game. They are obtained by killing enemies. Each enemy will drop a random number of coins and the player can collect these coins. The coins are later used to obtain
              skins from the Gacha Store.

**5. Gacha Store**: The Gacha Store is an additional section for the player to purchase cosmetics for their characters. There are 3 rarities in the Gacha Store which are Common, Uncommon and Rare. Each rarity has 
                    it's percentage of obtaining them. The rarer the item, the lower the chance of obtaining and vice versa.

**2.Coconut (Lunge Attack)**: The Coconut is a heavy type enemy which uses it's entire body to lunge at the player and deal higher damage. After they dealt their damage, they retreat and attempt to attack again
                              if they are in range with the player, if the player is not in range, The Coconut will continue to search the player.

**3.The Driller (Range Attack)**: The Driller is an actuall drilling tool that shoots screws at the player. Similar to The Coconut, if it is in range with the player, it stops and starts shooting screws at the     
                                  player. They then start chasing the player once the player leaves their range of fire.
