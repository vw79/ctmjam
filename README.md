# Game Description
'Forest Frenzy' is a 2D top down game made in the Unity Game Engine. In this action-packed game, players navigate through a thick jungle filled with vast vegetation. They are also faced with different variants of enemies such as Bolt, Coconut and The Driller. 

# Game Mechanics
**1. QTE Bar Combat System**: Players are greeted with a QTE Bar on their screen which is their attack system. Players have to successfully hit the red line at the correct timing when the white line aligns with the red line. Upon a successful hit, the character, which his name is 'Biggie' will emit a ranged coin explosion, which deals damage to nearby enemies and instantly kills them.

**2. Missed hit on the QTE Bar**: If the player accidentally misses the red line, nothing happens and the explosion is not emitted. However, if they spam the button and constantly miss the line, their combo multiplier, which is earned by eliminating enemies, will gradually decrease. So, if players want to keep their combo multiplier, they have to always time their hit correctly.

**3. Explosion Barrels**: Explosive barrels will be scattered around the jungle and players can use these barrels to their advantage. If they are near a barrel and they time their QTE correctly, they can also explode the barrel with their attack, which can instantly wipe out any nearby enemies. However, players have to be careful as the barrels can also damage the player.

**4. Coins**: Coins are one of the currency in the game. They are obtained by killing enemies. Each enemy will drop a random number of coins and the player can collect these coins. The coins are later used to obtain skins from the Gacha Store.

**5. Gacha Store**: The Gacha Store is an additional section for the player to purchase cosmetics for their characters. There are 3 rarities in the Gacha Store which are Common, Uncommon and Rare. Each rarity has it's percentage of obtaining them. The rarer the item, the lower the chance of obtaining and vice versa.


# How to Play
